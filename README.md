# How it works?

`Spritesheet Simplify` is an alternative of texture packer in generating spritesheets in your supplied spritesheets. It aims to merge your spritesinto one file called Spritesheet. Most 2D asset pack that can be found and purchase online consist of individual sprites. In 2D game development, spritesheet is used to animate character behaviour.Spritesheet Simplify aim only to merge all your sprites into spritesheet that could be use in your game development engine.

I recommend this simple application to those new developers that did not have any software to merge all your 2D sprites because it is easy to use.

This may not be as powerful as other tools out there but this tool could do the job to merge your sprites.

# Creating spritesheet in column

Select all your sprites behaviour in multiple selection and add it in the canvas.

Selected multiple files will be place in 1 row automatically.

# Creating spritesheet in rows

Instead of selecting multiple sprites, you can select sprites individually and place it in the canvas to display it in column.

# Custom spritesheet image properties

You can also customize the Image properties(width, height) of your spritesheet.

Navigate to the preview section, in preview you can modify spritesheet properties of the spritesheet (H for height, W for width)

# Spritesheet animation preview

Spritesheet simplify supports preview of animation of your supplied sprites

```
Note: as for now it only supports preview of multiple uploaded sprites.
In the future update maybe it can support preview of the single uploaded spritesheet.
```
