# spritesheet-simplify

# How it works?

`Spritesheet Simplify` aims to merge your spritesinto one file called Spritesheet. Most 2D asset pack that can be found and purchase online consist of individual sprites. In 2D game development, spritesheet is used to animate character behaviour.Spritesheet Generator aim only to merge all your sprites into spritesheet that could be use in your game development engine.

I recommend this simple application to those new developers that did not have any software to merge all your 2D sprites because it is easy to use.

This may not be as powerful as other tools out there but this tool could do the job to merge your sprites.


# Creating spritesheet in row

Select all your sprites behaviour in multiple selection and add it in the canvas.

Selected multiple files will be place in 1 row automatically.

# Creating spritesheet in column

Instead of selecting multiple sprites, you can select sprites individually and place it in the canvas to display it in column.

# Custom spritesheet image properties

You can also customize the Image properties(width, height and padding) of your spritesheet.

```Note: I recommend not to use custom sprite size when you have many type of behaviour in your sprites, especially when it has different sizes. Spritesheet Simplify does not support custom size in selected rows and columns. Custom size will be applied to all sprites in the canvas.```
